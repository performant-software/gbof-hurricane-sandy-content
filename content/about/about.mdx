During the last week of October in 2012, the East Coast was hit by the superstorm Hurricane Sandy. Many New Yorkers were left without access to food, clean water, and medical care, while hundreds of thousands lost their electricity. The storm caused $19 billion in damages, widespread economic loss, and the loss of 44 residents. How was New York City able to stand up and rebuild? With many comparisons to 9/11 and how the city came together, it is not surprising that this disaster would bring similar energy from New Yorkers to fight for their businesses and properties and to prosper through the power of community.
