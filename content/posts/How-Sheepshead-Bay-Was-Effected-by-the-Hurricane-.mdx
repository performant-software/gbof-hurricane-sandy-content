When Hurricane Sandy hit in October 2012, Sheepshead Bay, a waterfront neighborhood in Brooklyn, was heavily struck. The storm brought with it an exceptionally high storm surge that flooded streets, homes, and business areas with several feet of water. Homes located near the bay were highly destroyed and for the most part uninhabitable, while the neighborhood's marinas took extensive damage to its fishing boats, many vessels being washed ashore. Flooding knocked out electrical infrastructure, causing power outages that lasted from days to weeks, leaving residents without heat in the cold days after the storm. Businesses up and down Emmons Avenue were heavily affected, as many closed for repairs, while some would never reopen. The local fishing industry-which was at the core of the local economy-faced tremendous losses from destroyed boats and docks. The flooding took out the roads, disrupted public transportation, and showed just how deficient the flood defenses of the area were, with calls for stronger infrastructure. Later, federal aid and community resilience contributed to rebuilding after the storm, but many people recovered at a snail's pace. The storm showcased Sheepshead Bay's vulnerability to coastal flooding, and now there are some new building codes and flood-resistant construction to make it a bit more ready for the next big storm.
