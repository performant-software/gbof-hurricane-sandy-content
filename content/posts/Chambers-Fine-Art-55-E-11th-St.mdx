I wanted to showcase Chambers Fine Art because itself like many other art galleries in the area lost a majority of its collection or received major damage to its pieces. Many Gallerists had moved some of the collections to storage facilities in Brooklyn but some were able to and prepared for the expected rain fall. Many expected 1 foot of water but they ended up with 4 feet. Before Is a link to a New York Times article talking about this.
