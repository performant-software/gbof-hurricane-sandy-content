**Community support after power outages**

Intro to the Chinatown neighborhood

When these natural disasters happen most of the time if not all the communities are affected by low income, people of color, immigrants, working class people. City officials were absent and CAAAV really helped the neighborhood, to just help the community meet their basic necessities.     

Throughout the four day balcony the neighborhood was forced to make do with whatever supplies available. Residents on high rise apartments lost running water and elevator service, causing hardship for neighborhood seniors who were stuck on upper levels. Many residents in this primarily working class or small businesses were losing money everyday during the aftermath of the messy storm.
