Emmons Avenue, located in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood in, South Brooklyn, was severely affected by Hurricane Sandy. Due to its proximity to the canal, Emmons Avenue faced impacts, with local businesses being flooded by over four feet of water. Many businesses remained closed for months, while some were forced to shut down or relocate due to the damages. The bridge connecting Emmons Avenue to Shore Boulevard was also damaged and required significant repairs. Additionally, the canal became polluted with debris, including litter, parts of homes, and fragments of the bridge.
