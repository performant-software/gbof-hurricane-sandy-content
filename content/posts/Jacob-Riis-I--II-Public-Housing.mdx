35 NYCHA (NYC Housing Authority) developments that were damaged by extreme flooding received funding from FEMA to increase flood resiliency for future storms. These housing developments suffered from intense flooding and power outages that lasted several days. Among these developments were the Jacob Riis I & II Houses in the Lower East Side. This development used FEMA funding to add flood protection to windows and doors. This funding was also used to move electrical panels and switch gears to higher elevations, as well as install rooftop generators that start within one minute of a power outage.
