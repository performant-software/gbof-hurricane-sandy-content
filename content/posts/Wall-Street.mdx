The literal wall that gave Wall Street its name was originally built by the slaves ordered by the Dutch West India Company. The wall was a wooden defensive barrier designed to protect the settlers from external threats, including potential attacks from the British, and the Native American tribes. The wall ran along what is now Wall Street, extending from the East River to the Hudson River, marking the northern boundary of the settlement.

This wall represented the physical and symbolic separation between the European settlers and the indigenous Lenape people. Dutch West India Company organized the construction in New Amsterdam, using enslaved Africans and local colonists as labor.

Although it was primarily defensive, the wall also became a commercial area over time. Traders and merchants gathered around this site, eventually evolving into a hub for financial transactions. When Hurricane Sandy struck in 2012, Wall Street was hit particularly hard by the storm's storm surge and flooding. The area around Wall Street was inundated with seawater, causing power outages, halting financial markets, and shutting down the New York Stock Exchange for two days.Â
