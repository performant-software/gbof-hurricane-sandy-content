The New York Stock Exchange shut down for 2 days to ensure the safety of those who worked there during the height of Hurricane Sandy. This was the first time since 1888 that the Stock Market closed for 2 days due to weather. Because the financial district was a mandatory evacuation zone, mass transportation stopped and people couldn't come in for work. The original plan was for the NYSE to be closed for 1 day but during the storm, much of Lower Manhattan flooded and lost power, causing it to be closed for 2 days. While the closure didn't affect many stocks or trading, the economy took a significant hit with the damage from the hurricane.
