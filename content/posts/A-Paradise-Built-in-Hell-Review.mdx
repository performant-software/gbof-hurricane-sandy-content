A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster, a perspective book Rebecca Solnit. This inspiring book challenges the wisdom that catastrophes bring out the worst in people by demonstrating how they may also bring to light our greatest potential for empathy, teamwork and action. 

Hurricane Katrina, the 9/11 attacks, and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake are just a few of the historical and modern disasters that Solnit explores. She reveals a recurrent pattern through detailed research and powerful storytelling and communities frequently come together in the face of disaster showing amazing resolve and unity. The book highlights that, rather from leading to chaos, disasters inspire individuals to strengthen their connections and create possibilities for aid and  Solnit's highlights the generally negative views of human behavior amid crises then providing a more positive perspective of community dynamics. 

While reading I reflected on how myself and those around me might better anticipate and respond to future crises. By embracing the concepts of mutual aid and resilience, we may may work to create a society in which these ideas are woven into the structure of our daily lives rather than emerging just during disasters.
