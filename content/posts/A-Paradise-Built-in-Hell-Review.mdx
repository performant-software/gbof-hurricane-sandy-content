\*\*A Paradise Built in Hell: \*\*The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster, a perspective book Rebecca Solnit. This inspiring book challenges the wisdom that catastrophes bring out the worst in people by demonstrating how they may also bring to light our greatest potential for empathy, teamwork and action.

Hurricane Katrina, the 9/11 attacks, and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake are just a few of the historical and modern disasters that Solnit explores. She reveals a recurrent pattern through detailed research and powerful storytelling and communities frequently come together in the face of disaster showing amazing resolve and unity. The book highlights that, rather from leading to chaos, disasters inspire individuals to strengthen their connections and create possibilities for aid and  Solnit's highlights the generally negative views of human behavior amid crises then providing a more positive perspective of community dynamics.

While reading I reflected on how myself and those around me might better anticipate and respond to future crises. By embracing the concepts of mutual aid and resilience, we may may work to create a society in which these ideas are woven into the structure of our daily lives rather than emerging just during disasters.

\*\*Salvage the Bones: \*\*Salvage the Bones by Jesmyn Ward is a very beautiful and tragic novel set in the days preceding Hurricane Katrina. The novel is told through the eyes of a poor family in Mississippi. This story follows Esch who is a fifteen-year-old girl who deals with early pregnancy while her siblings and father prepare for the storm. The novel describes the vulnerability of communities that have limited resources to prepare for and respond to natural disasters. The destruction that is brought by Katrina highlights the unfair advantage placed on communities of low-income, communities of color as they lack the infrastructure to shield themselves from these casualties.

“There is a sweetness that only comes with ruin”

The power of community is what’s most important to this story. Strong community helps A sense of shared resilience with everyone of the siblings and family friend roles helps strengthen the support after the storm. While reading the novel I reflected on how when the Sandy Archive started I wanted to focus on the sense of community that comes with natural disasters. Jesmyn Ward writes these very real characters that stick with you and make readers question and be aware of privileges they may have unlike what this family faces.
