Focusing on the Seaport district the water flooded this area to about 6 feet. At the end of 2021, the mayor’s office of climate and environmental justice came up with the Financial District and Seaport Climate Resilience Master Plan. The design includes a layered boardwalk that expands the East River’s waterfront to 200 feet from its current site in order to save the neighborhood which was affected by Hurricane Sandy. The top level of this design will include public areas and be raised by around 15 to 18 feet to provide protection from future storms like Sandy. The bottom level will consist of a walkway, which is enhanced five feet to provide sea level rise protection for all to enjoy and the neighborhood to be safe.
