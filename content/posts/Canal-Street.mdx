During Hurricane Sandy, Canal Street in New York City was significantly affected by flooding. Floodwaters reached the corner of Canal and Hudson Streets, contributing to the extensive flooding in Lower Manhattan. The storm's surge, combined with high tides, led to water levels rising dramatically, inundating streets and buildings in the area. This flooding was part of the broader impact of Sandy, which caused widespread damage and power outages across New York City.
