After Hurricane Sandy struck Queens in October 2012, PS 207 in Howard Beach was severely damaged by flooding, leaving its basement filled with water, oil, and requiring extensive repairs. Despite the significant damage, including a destroyed electrical system, the school underwent rapid reconstruction and reopened on January 2, 2013. During the recovery period, students were temporarily relocated to other schools, and the administration kept parents informed. The schoolâ€™s reopening marked a swift recovery, with families expressing satisfaction with the relocation process and the efforts to restore the building.
