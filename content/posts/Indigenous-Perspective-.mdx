This area was inhabited by Indigenous people who coexisted peacefully with the environment long before the tall buildings and busy streets of New York City. In order to preserve biodiversity and ecological balance, the Lenape tribe practiced cautious care over their land, employing sustainable methods including managed fires and selective crops. Climate change is posing serious problems for NYC. Extreme weather events are happening more frequently, urbanization is putting stress on ecosystems and rising sea levels pose a threat to coastal communities.

The difference between environmental effects and historical stewardship highlights how important it is to use Indigenous knowledge into the planning of the city's environmental destiny. By adopting Indigenous viewpoints on sustainability which regard the Earth as a partner rather than a resource, New York City may pave the way for environmental harmony and resilience. The city can pay tribute to its history while building a more sustainable and just future for all of its residents by incorporating renewable energy, rehabilitating natural ecosystems and using sustainable land management practices.
